	<p>As an energetic individual with a passion to help people through technology, I strongly believe in looking at the glass half full. Always looking to be inspired and serve as inspiration.</p>
	<p>My name is Sania Bishnoi and I am a fourth year at University of California, Irvine studying Informatics with a specialization in Human-Computer-Interaction. I am minoring in Statistics as well. With this background I plan on going into Technology Consulting for a few years before I obtain my MBA.  I am really interested in technological trends such as Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning and Internet of Things. </p> 
	<p>Besides school I am very much in tune with my culture. I love Bollywood and have been part of my schoolâ€™s competitive Bollywood dance team for two consecutive years. I am also part of the Indian Sub continental Club where I was the creative head for the 2016 culture show production. </p>
